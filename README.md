# *Dynamic Network Routing Simulation Using Dijkstra's Algorithm*

## *Overview*

This project simulates dynamic network routing using *Dijkstra's Algorithm*. The system efficiently computes the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph, which can represent a network of interconnected devices or routers. The simulation adapts dynamically to changes in network conditions, such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges, or weight adjustments.

---

## *Features*

- Implementation of *Dijkstra's Algorithm* for shortest-path computation.
- Dynamic updates to the graph (add/remove nodes and edges).
- Visualization of the network and routing paths.
- Performance metrics for pathfinding efficiency.
- Supports simulation of real-world scenarios such as network failures or congestion.

## *Technologies Used*

- *Programming Language:* Python/Java (Specify the language)
- *Libraries:* 
  - For Python: networkx, matplotlib, etc.
  - For Java: JavaFX, Graph libraries, etc.
- *Development Tools:* Git, IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

## *Getting Started*

### *Prerequisites*

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (≥3.8) or Java (≥11)
- Git
- Required libraries or dependencies:
  - For Python: Install using pip install networkx matplotlib.
  - For Java: Add dependencies for graph handling libraries if needed.

### *Installation*

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darshan-T-P/Dynamic-Network-Routing-Stimulation.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   bash
   cd Dynamic-Network-Routing-Stimulation
   
3. Install required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects
   
   (Skip this for Java projects.)

---

## *Usage*

1. Run the main script:
   bash
   python main.py  # For Python
   
   Or, compile and run for Java:
   bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
   - Visualize the network graph.
   - Update nodes and edges dynamically.
   - Compute and display the shortest paths.

3. Explore scenarios like:
   - Adding new routes (edges).
   - Simulating link failures.
   - Measuring rerouting times.

## *Example*

Input Graph:

A --2--> B --3--> C
|         |         |
5         4         6
|         |         |
D --1--> E --2--> F


Shortest Path from A to F:

Path: A → B → C → F
Cost: 11
